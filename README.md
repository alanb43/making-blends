# making-blends

Linguists have often noticed that natural languages can often be compressed, but still fairly easy to understand because humans 
are fairly good at pattern seeking. For instances, if I mistyped the phrase "in this issue here" as "in thissue here", you can 
still understand what I was trying to say.

This project squeezes words with the same beginning and ending characters on each line together, even across multi-character
matches, multi-word merges, and extraneous cases such as test case 5 in the test case text file.
