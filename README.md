Researchers have noticed that due to humans being good at pattern seeking, often natural languages can be constricted while 
maintaining readability. For example, if I mis-wrote "i forget to take the trash out often" as "i forgeto take the trash out
often", one could quickly determine what I meant to say.

This project squeezes words with the same beginning and ending characters on each line together, even across multi-character
matches, multi-word merges, and extraneous cases such as test case 5 in the test case text file.
