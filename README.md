# making-blends

Researchers have noticed that due to humans being good at pattern seeking, often natural languages can be constricted while 
maintaining readability. For example, if I mis-wrote "i forget to take the trash out often" as "i forgeto take the trash out
often", one could quickly determine what I meant to say.

This project squeezes words with the same beginning and ending characters on each line together, even across multi-character
matches, multi-word merges, and extraneous cases such as test case 5 in the test case text file.

Viewing the [test-cases.txt file](https://github.com/alanb43/making-blends/test-cases.txt) will convey this program's function
through various examples if this brief description did not do so well enough.

This program has been refactored according to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), 
something I'm trying to get more comfortable with / better at using.
